# Dark mode chrome extension

#### I made this after a lot struggling ;)

So the icons are from --> [`icons8.com`](https://icons8.com/icons/set/dark-mode)
and the reference for this repo is from --> [`Argieg419's repo`](https://github.com/Arieg419/MediumDarkMode)
and lastly thanks to `Betafist#7810 (discord)` for mentioning this project in [YouAskWeBuild Discord server](https://discord.gg/m7GhgH6cdt)
